# TDGPT: Test Driven GPT

## Project rationale

In the wake of chatGPT and in turn GPT-4, many developers are either
concerned about being replaced outright by LLM AI or are considering use of 
LLM AI to implement the functionality they desire. 
Moreover, many developers are considering simply automating the writing of
tests for the code that they already have or are already developing.

Conversely, others are concerned about the limitations of AI-generated code 
given the provided prompts, in particular with regards to proper testing
practice: indeed, the role of generative AI in software development
remains controversial and warrants healthy skepticism.

But there's another possibility: what if, instead of generating tests for
our code, LLMs can generate code given sufficiently sophisticated tests?

Results and observations in this area will be tracked, so watch this space!
